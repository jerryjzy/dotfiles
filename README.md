# dotfiles

Keep my dotfiles in one place. Not all config files are original work.
I modified copycat-killer's awesome wm configurations. Neovim configurations
are modified from someone's a long time ago, but not much of the originals are
left now.

## Installation
Configurations are organized by programs. To install using stow, clone the repo
to home folder, and execute following command:

```
stow [program]
```
